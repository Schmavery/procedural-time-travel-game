procedural-time-travel-game
===========================

Time travel in a procedurally generated world.  A forever project.

Explanation of project:
=======================

procedural-time-v1.0 is the original attempt at a realization of the project.  It currently gives the best idea of the goal in mind (though is still very far from the eventual imagined end-goal).  It basically consists of some basic procedurally generated terrain, dumb NPCs, useless items (that can be picked up!) and a very basic inventory/UI system.  This branch of the project has been mostly abandoned because it uses java2d, which proved to be slow.

procedural-time-v2.0 is an attempt to rewrite the project using lwjgl for graphics.  It makes use of several external libraries, namely lwjgl, slick-utils and jdom.
